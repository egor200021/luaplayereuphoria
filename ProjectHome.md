LuaPlayer Euphoria is a continuation of the LuaPlayer project created by Shine.
It offers a host of improvements (mainly speed) and maintains the original LuaPlayer syntax, so it's easy for people who use the old LuaPlayer to migrate to LuaPlayer Euphoria.

What is it?

LuaPlayer Euphoria is a Lua Interpreter for the PSP. It allows you to quickly create games or applications using the powerful Lua scripting language.

Some of its features :

Vfpu math library.
Fast Image Blitting.
MP3, At3 & Ogg playback via the PSP Media Engine.
Wav support.
Png & Jpeg Image support.
IntraFont support.
Sony Utility's support (dialog, osk etc)
File I/O.

Future :

I am looking for any C programmers who are interested in joining me to further improve this project. If you are a C programmer and are interested in contributing to this project, please send me an email (you will find my email address in the source code) and I will get back to you asap.
